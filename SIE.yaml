- rule: Force older TPM compatibility combined failure as ignored
    The ACS SCT test is verifying compatibility with TPM capabilities 1.0.
    U-Boot up to at least version 2023.10 does not support TPM capabilities 1.0
    and also erroneously returns BUFFER_TOO_SMALL in this case instead of
    SUCCESS.
    BBSR does not mandate compatibility with older TPM capabilities 1.0;
    it only requires TCG2, TPM capabilities 1.1.

    The SIE ACS checks that MaxVariableStorageSize is larger than 128kb as per
