- rule: Force dropped TPM as ignored
    BBSR v1.1 does not mandate use of a TPM; the requirements of section 2.4
    "TPMs and measured boot" must be followed only if a TPM is implemented.

- rule: Force BBSR variable size test failure as known RPMB limitation.
    The SIE ACS checks that MaxVariableStorageSize is larger than 128kb as per
    rule R040_BBSR of BBSR v1.1.
    That is typically not the case when using OP-TEE's secure storage on eMMC
    RPMB.
